# DataDiddler
## Built With AI, Not Powered by AI

DataDiddler was designed and implemented with extensive assistance from artificial intelligence during its creation.

The project began as an experiment: what would happen if a file-dump AI were asked to act as a semantic filter — something that could notice when pieces of data became interesting enough to keep? Over a short, intensive period, hooks were developed collaboratively, one by one, by repeatedly articulating what *should* count as significance and encoding those judgments as explicit rules.

In practice:
- the core hook system was built through focused, iterative design
- a simple, legible user experience was added
- real data was loaded to test edge cases and refine behavior

A Mature Lens built by Mettle Forge Lab, Aria Itara - Technician Mode V2,  was used at design time to explore architecture, generate code, and iterate on structure. DataDiddler was constructed over six days in January 2026 using two instances of Aria on an old iPhone 11 and a GE75 Raider laptop. It is a novel artifact. The resulting system reflects those design-time decisions.

At runtime, however, DataDiddler uses:
- no machine learning models
- no probabilistic inference
- no embeddings
- no LLM calls

All runtime behavior is deterministic, rule-based, and auditable. Any sense of “intelligence” comes from the accumulation and ordering of explicit constraints — not from learned behavior.

In other words: AI helped build the tool, but the tool itself runs on mechanics.
